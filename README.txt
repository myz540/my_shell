/************************************************************
Mike Zhong CS575 Program 1

To compile, just use the Makefile provided by typing 'make',
followed by './main' in the terminal. Or you can type
'g++ -o main CS575_myz540_p1.cc' and execute using './main'

I did not have time to implement all the features and would
not consider this my best work. I could not figure out how 
to implement pipelining but the input and output redirection
works as long as there are spaces before and after the '<'
or '>'. The '&' allows programs to run in the background but
must be appended directly to the program name, like 'emacs&'.
